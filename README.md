# Edu4All_UN_Hackathon
UNESCO has been promoting Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) since 1992.Education is both a goal in itself and a means for attaining all the other Sustainable development goals(SDGs). It is not only an integral part of sustainable development, but also a key enabler for it. That is why education represents an essential strategy in the pursuit of the SDGs. This dashboard provides UNSECO more insights on each country's effort and progress to improve the education system.
